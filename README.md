# win2019-base-ami

Provides code and configuration to build a base Windows Server 2019 AMI

### Ansible

All Ansible configuration resides in the `./ansible` directory. The Ansible configuration will be called during the provisioning step of the Packer build as defined in `./packer/build.pkr.hcl`.

### Powershell

Powershell scripts required to bootstrap the WinRM connection used for Ansible provisioning are stored in the `./powershell` directory and are called during the provisioning step of the Packer build as defined in `./packer/build.pkr.hcl`.

### Packer Variables

All Packer configuration resides in the `./packer` directory and utilises standard Packer configuration syntax.
